# Length penalty for principal curve
- Length penalty is a potential solution for the problem of hyperparameter tunning in estimating principal curves. Our proposed novel length penalty for low order spline is the first attempt to directly penalize the length of the principal curve.
- Optimized with an efficient first-order algorithm in Rcpp, our implemented R package is public available on \github{ZhuolinSong}.
